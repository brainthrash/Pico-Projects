This is the projects that I am creating to use my Raspberry PI Pico for potential
Geocache hides.

These projects are inspired by caches that I've found in the Catalina State Park area.

Project List:
- Servo - Test Project for being able to control a servo motor to activate a latch.
- Morse Code - Flashes an LED when powered up to give a combination code for a lock.
